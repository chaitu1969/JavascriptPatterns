This repository demonstrates various **design patterns** commonly used in Node.js applications. These patterns help in writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code.

---

## 1. Module Pattern

<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">The Module Pattern</span> is fundamental to Node.js as it allows for code encapsulation and reuse by creating isolated modules. This improves code readability and testing.

---

## 2. Singleton Pattern

<span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">The Singleton Pattern</span> ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application lifecycle. It is useful for managing database connections or caching.

---

## 3. Factory Pattern

<span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">The Factory Pattern</span> allows object creation without specifying the exact class. This is useful for handling different object types dynamically.

---

## 4. Proxy Pattern

<span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">The Proxy Pattern</span> adds a layer between a client and an object, often for controlling access or adding behaviors like caching or validation.

---

## 5. Decorator Pattern

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">The Decorator Pattern</span> enhances the functionality of an object at runtime without changing its core structure. This is useful for adding behaviors like logging or authentication.

---

## 6. Observer Pattern

<span style="color:teal; font-weight:bold">The Observer Pattern</span> allows objects to subscribe and react to events or changes in state. Node.jsâ€™ `EventEmitter` is an example of this pattern.

---

## 7. Command Pattern

<span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold">The Command Pattern</span> encapsulates requests as objects, enabling parameterization, queuing, or undo capabilities.

---

## 8. Strategy Pattern

<span style="color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">The Strategy Pattern</span> defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable, useful for scenarios like payment processing or sorting.

---

## 9. Middleware Pattern

<span style="color:darkgreen; font-weight:bold">The Middleware Pattern</span> allows request processing through a series of functions, commonly used in Express.js.

---

## 10. Asynchronous Pattern

<span style="color:darkred; font-weight:bold">Asynchronous Patterns</span> like `async/await` and promises are essential for non-blocking I/O operations in Node.js.

---

### Conclusion

Using these design patterns ensures your Node.js applications are well-structured, maintainable, and scalable. These examples serve as a starting point for implementing robust solutions in real-world projects.
